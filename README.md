# Income Tax Curve

### Description
No one likes it, everyone still has to pay it. 
Until now I didn't fully understand how it is calculated, so I visualized it with a curve and some details.
The project is written in JS and I used my old [DivDraw](https://github.com/MatteoKoch/DivDraw) library for the graphs.
